#multiple assignment allows us to assign multiple variables at the same time with one line of code. Even if the variables are different data types

name, age, male = "Jason", 47, True

print(name)
print(age)
print(male)

#set multiple variables to the same value
Jason = Mike = Bob = Dave = "Male"
print(Mike)
