Python commands and notes

python3 --version 

Strings
    Double or single quotes, no difference
    Print a string
        print("This is cool")
    f-strings (formatted string literals) use curly braces to replace expressions with their values
        ex: print(f"20 days are {20 * 24 * 60} minutes")

Integer (Int)
    Whole number, positive or negative, without decimals

Floating Point Number (Float)
    Positive or negative number containing 1 or more decimals

3 types of functions
    1) Built-in functions native to Python
    2) Functions that we create and define using "def"
    3) Functions called on a data type. Ex. "2, 3".split() is calling the split function on a list (could also be a variable)
        - Each data type has its own built-in functions, which are useful and/or make sense for that specific data type 
        - the () after the function allows you to enter additional parameters specific to that function
